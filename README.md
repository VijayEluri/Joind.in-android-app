### Welcome

Joind.in welcomes all contributors regardless of your ability or experience. We especially welcome
you if you are new to Open Source development and will provide a helping hand. To ensure that
everyone understands what we expect from our community, our projects have a [Contributor Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and by participating in the development of joind.in you agree to abide
by its terms.

## Building the application

The application should be set up as any other Android project.
Please read the documentation on how to [configure OAuth2](/oauth_configuration.md) before you build.

Building requires that you have the following items installed:

* Gradle
* Android SDK (at least SDK version 22)

To build with Gradle, run:

    gradle build

in the project root. The output APK is produced in `build/outputs/apk`.

## Installation

To install the application on a connected device:

    adb install -r build/output/apk/<name of output APK>.apk

## Crashlytics

The joind.in app uses the Crashlytics library to handle crash reporting. You shouldn't
need to do anything out of the ordinary, as Gradle will handle pulling in the Crashlytics
dependency. There are Crashlytics plugins for all the major IDEs however, but they don't
add anything extra to the build process so not essential to have installed.
